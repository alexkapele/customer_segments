## Topic: Unsupervised Learning

## Description

In this project, the annual spending of customers of a wholesale distributor on various product categories are analysed and used to train an unsupervised learning model. The aim is to divide the customers into groups according to their spending characteristics in order to provide the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
